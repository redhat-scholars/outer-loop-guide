= Continuous Delivery with OpenShift Pipelines
:navtitle: Continuous Delivery with OpenShift Pipelines

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about deployment pipelines and you will create a pipeline to 
automate build and deployment of the Inventory service.

[sidebar]
.Continuous Delivery
--
So far you have been deploying each service manually to OpenShift. Although 
it's convenient for local development, it's an error-prone way of delivering software if 
extended to test and production environments.

Continuous Delivery (CD) refers to a set of practices with the intention of automating 
various aspects of delivery software. One of these practices is called **Delivery Pipeline** 
which is an automated process to define the steps a change in code or configuration has 
to go through in order to reach upper environments and eventually to production. 

OpenShift simplifies building CI/CD Pipelines by integrating TektonCD into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly from within OpenShift.

== Create a custom Task

You have learnt and understood how to create a simple **Pipeline**.
Now, let's **create a task to deploy the OpenShift Configuration from Argo CD and add it the existing pipeline**.

[TIP]
====
A **Task** consists of a collection of **Steps** that are executed sequentially with a pod. 

Each **Step** is executed in a separate container within the same pod. 
They can also have inputs and outputs in order to interact with other tasks in the pipeline.
====

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^,role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Search' -> 'Task' -> 'T Task' -> 'Create Task'*`.

`*Then update the content as follows:*`

[source,yaml,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: argocd-task-sync-and-wait
  namespace: cn-project{USER_ID}
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "0.1"
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/pipelines.minVersion: "0.12.1"
    tekton.dev/tags: deploy
    tekton.dev/displayName: "argocd"
spec:
  description: >-
    This task syncs (deploys) an Argo CD application and waits for it to be healthy.
    To do so, it requires the address of the Argo CD server and some form of
    authentication either a username/password or an authentication token.
  params:
    - name: application-name
      description: name of the application to sync
  stepTemplate:
    envFrom:
      - configMapRef:
          name: argocd-env-configmap  # used for server address
      - secretRef:
          name: argocd-env-secret  # used for authentication (username/password or auth token)
  steps:
    - name: login-sync-and-wait
      image: argoproj/argocd:v1.7.6
      script: |
        if [ -z $ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN ]; then
          yes | argocd login $ARGOCD_SERVER --username=$ARGOCD_USERNAME --password=$ARGOCD_PASSWORD --plaintext;
        fi
        argocd app sync $(params.application-name){USER_ID}
        argocd app wait $(params.application-name){USER_ID} --health
----

`*Then click on 'create'*`. Your Argo CD Task is now created.

image::openshift-argocd-task.png[OpenShift - ArgoCD Task, 500]

Now let's **define the Argo CD server endpoint as well as the credentials so that the Task you just created has access to the server**.

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^,role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Config Maps' then click on the 'Create Config Map' button*`.

image::openshift-create-configmap.png[Che - OpenShift Create Config Map, 900]

Then `*replace the content*` with the following input:

[source,yaml,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-env-configmap
  namespace: cn-project{USER_ID}
data:
  ARGOCD_SERVER: argocd-server.argocd.svc
----

`*Click on the 'Create' button.*` 

Then `*click on 'Secrets' -> 'Create' -> 'Key/Value Secret'*`.

image::openshift-create-keyvalue-secret-menu.png[Che - OpenShift Create Secret, 900]

`*Enter the following configuration*`:

.ArgoCD Task Secret
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Secret Name * 
|argocd-env-secret

|===

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Key 
|Value

|ARGOCD_USERNAME
|user{USER_ID}

|ARGOCD_PASSWORD
|{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}

|===

image::openshift-create-keyvalue-secret.png[Che - OpenShift Create Secret, 500]

`*Click on the 'Create' button*` 


== Expand your Pipeline

Now let's **expand your Inventory Pipeline to cover the Continuous Deployment**.

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^,role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Pipelines' -> 'PL inventory-pipeline' -> 'Actions' -> 'Edit Pipeline'*`

then, `*complete your pipeline*` with the following two *Red Hat tasks* and their configurations:

image::openshift-full-inventory-pipeline.png[OpenShift Pipeline,900]

.ArgoCD Task Configuration
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Section
|Parameter 
|Value

|Name
|argocd-task-sync-and-wait 
|
|Parameters
|application-name * 
|inventory

|===

.OpenShift Client Task Configuration
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Section
|Parameter 
|Value

|Name
|openshift-client 
|
|Parameters
|SCRIPT 
|oc rollout status deployment/inventory-coolstore

|===


== Run the Full Pipeline

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^,role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Pipelines' -> 'PL inventory-pipeline' -> 'Actions' -> 'Start last run'*`

[TIP]
====
**Start last run** will run your pipeline with the previous parameters i.e with the previous PVC created for the shared workspace
====

Congratulations!! You have deployed your first application using OpenShift Pipeline!!

image::openshift-run-full-inventory-pipeline.png[OpenShift Pipeline,900]

Once finished, from the **Topology view**, `*select the 'cn-project{USER_ID}'*`.

image::openshift-tekton-inventory-deployed.png[OpenShift - Inventory Deployed by Tekton, 700]

Now, you can see that the **Inventory Service has been deployed by OpenShift Pipeline** and it is up and running.

In the {GITOPS_URL}[Argo CD^,role='params-link'], `*Select the 'Application menu' then click on the 'inventory{USER_ID}' application*`:

image::argocd-sync-inventory-application.png[Argo CD - Out Of Sync Application, 900]

Argo CD has synchronized all the Inventory OpenShift manifests stored into your {GIT_URL}/user{USER_ID}/inventory-gitops[Inventory Repository^,role='params-link'] with your 'cn-project{USER_ID}' project on OpenShift.

== Deploy the whole application with Tekton

Previously, for the **Inventory Service**, you have learned how to create, configure and run an OpenShift pipeline.
Now, `*let's deploy the rest of the application*`.

For doing so, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'che: Pipeline - Deploy Coolstore'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 600]

Once executed, in the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^,role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,

`*Click on 'Pipelines' -> 'PL - coolstore-java-pipeline' -> 'Pipeline Runs'*`

image::openshift-coolstore-java-pipeline-run.png[OpenShift Pipeline Runs, 700]

You should see 1 pipeline running for the other Java service (Catalog).

`*Click on 'Pipelines' -> 'PL - coolstore-dotnet-pipeline' -> 'Pipeline Runs'*`

image::openshift-coolstore-dotnet-pipeline-run.png[OpenShift Pipeline Runs, 700]

You should see 1 pipeline running for the the .NET service (Gateway).

`*Click on 'Pipelines' -> 'PL - coolstore-nodejs-pipeline' -> 'Pipeline Runs'*`

image::openshift-coolstore-nodejs-pipeline-run.png[OpenShift Pipeline Runs, 700]

You should see 1 pipeline running for the NodeJs service (Web).

`*Click on 'Topology'*` from the **Developer view** of the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^,role='params-link']
and validate that the CoolStore application is deployed, up and running in the **cn-project{USER_ID}** project.

image::openshift-tekton-coolstore-deployed.png[OpenShift - Coolstore Deployed by Tekton, 500]

Finally, in {GITOPS_URL}[Argo CD^,role='params-link'], all Applications are now 'Synced'.

image::argocd-synced-coolstore.png[Argo CD - Sync Application, 900]

Well done! You are ready for the next lab.
